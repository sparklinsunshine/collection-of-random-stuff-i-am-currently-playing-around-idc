hello.
idk why y'all here
whatever junk files i had in my laptop (the ones i decided to keep unlike the ones i've erased out of existence out of frustration) are in this repo
this is proof that i ain't dumb i am just not guided right
i finally figured out how to ACTUALLY do a project after my internship (credits to my mentor he is god)
go through it ig, you won't find much interseting stuff
